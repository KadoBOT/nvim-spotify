## Requirements

> Unlike other Spotify plugins, you don't need to create an app, and no server is needed on your machine. Although, you still need to authorize this plugin, so it can control your music.

A refresh token. You need to authorize  the `nvim-spotify` app through [this link](https://europe-west3-nvim-spotify.cloudfunctions.net/login-4b8c731) and add the refresh_token that is returned to the plugin configuration.

- Golang
- Telescope

## Installation

### [packer](https://github.com/wbthomason/packer.nvim)
```lua
-- Lua
use {
    'KadoBOT/nvim-spotify', 
    requires = 'nvim-telescope/telescope.nvim',
    config = function()
        local spotify = require'nvim-spotify'

        spotify.setup {
            refresh_token = "YOUR_REFRESH_TOKEN"
        }
    end,
    run = 'make'
}
```

### [vim-plug](https://github.com/junegunn/vim-plug)
```viml
Plug 'KadoBOT/nvim-spotify', { 'do': 'make' }
```


## Configuration

A valid refresh_token is required for this plugin to work. You can retrieve yours after authorizing the app [using this link](https://europe-west3-nvim-spotify.cloudfunctions.net/login-4b8c731)

## Usage

### Default keymaps:
The following keymaps are set by default when the Spotify plugin window is open:
```plain
{"n", "<Esc>"} // close the plugin window
{"n", "q"} // close the plugin window
{"n", "<C-N>"} // Select the next device in the list
{"n", "<Tab>"} // Select the next device in the list
{"n", "<S-Tab>"} // Select the previous device in the list
{"n", "<C-P>"} // Select the previous device in the list
{"n", "<C-T>"} // Search for tracks
{"n", "<C-R>"} // Search for artists
{"n", "<C-L>"} // Search for albums
{"n", "<C-Y>"} // Search for playlists
{"i", "<CR>"}  // Search for tracks
{"i", "<C-N>"} // Select the next device in the list
{"i", "<Tab>"} // Select the next device in the list
{"i", "<C-P>"} // Select the previous device in the list
{"i", "<S-Tab>"} // Select the previous device in the list
{"i", "<C-T>"} // Search for tracks
{"i", "<C-R>"} // Search for artists
{"i", "<C-L>"} // Search for albums
{"i", "<C-Y>"} // Search for playlists
```

### Extra keymaps
 You can also define the additional following keymaps
```lua
vim.api.nvim_set_keymap("n", "<leader>sn", "<Plug>(SpotifySkip)",  { silent = true }) -- Skip the current track
vim.api.nvim_set_keymap("n", "<leader>sp", "<Plug>(SpotifyPause)", , { silent = true }) -- Pause/Resume the current track
vim.api.nvim_set_keymap("n", "<leader>ss", "<Plug>(SpotifySave)",  { silent = true }) -- Add the current track to your library
vim.api.nvim_set_keymap("n", "<leader>so", ":Spotify<CR>",  { silent = true }) -- Open Spotify plugin window
```

## Sponsoring

As you might have noticed, I'm hosting the server for handling all the requests on GCP, so you don't have to run it on your machine. While a single request is not expensive, a single user makes 5 requests every time it opens the plugin and run a search. With the increasing amount of users using this plugin, this might get more expensive. With that said, please consider sponsoring me. Thanks!
